# Magnet Lab Report
The best way to install the jupyter notebook dependencies is to install conda and activate the provided environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`<br>
To utilize the environment and ensure the code runs on your computer, download miniconda from [conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## Data
The data was taken through Google Science Journal on iOS 14.
Each test was run for 5 seconds 5 times, and then exported to a .csv file. 
The raw files are in `./magnet-data`.

The gathered data was analyzed using matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and scipy.stats. 

## Figures
Check `./figs` for .png files of the data from each of the results.
